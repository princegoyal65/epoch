> Efficient and Fair Line Construction Project.

The project title should be concise and self-explanatory so that the user can easily remember your project.

Add a cover banner to the top of your Readme to catch the attention of your readers.
I usually include images that are relevant to my project, and you can easily find any image for free online without worrying about copyright issues. However, if the work is not free, make sure to credit the proper owners in the references/acknowledgement section.

The colorful tiles beneath the title are known as badges, and they improve readability by providing quick insights into the github repository. I use [Shields IO](https://shields.io/). Depending on the project you can use the ones that are relevant. 

# Project Overview

The Efficient and Fair Line Construction project aims to construct a gas pipeline in a straight line that serves a set of 
houses with coordinates given by latitude and longitude. The project focuses on optimizing the pipeline placement to 
achieve efficiency and fairness while considering the distances from houses to the pipeline.


# Installation and Setup

In this section, provide detailed instructions on how to set up the project on a local machine. This includes any necessary dependencies, software requirements, and installation steps. Make sure to include clear and concise instructions so that others can easily replicate your setup.

I like to structure it as below - 
## Codes and Resources Used
In this section I give user the necessary information about the software requirements.
- **Editor Used:**  Informing the user of the editor used to produce the project.
- **Python Version:** Informing the user of the version of python used for this project. If you are using some other language such as R, you can mention that as well.

## Python Packages Used
In this section, I include all the necessary dependencies needed to reproduce the project, so that the reader can install them before replicating the project. I categorize the long list of packages used as - 
- **General Purpose:** General purpose packages like `urllib, os, request`, and many more.
- **Data Manipulation:** Packages used for handling and importing dataset such as `pandas, numpy` and others.
- **Data Visualization:** Include packages which were used to plot graphs in the analysis or for understanding the ML modelling such as `seaborn, matplotlib` and others.
- **Machine Learning:** This includes packages that were used to generate the ML model such as `scikit, pandas`, etc.


## Data Acquisition
Dataset is provided we have given califorina housing dataset which we have get from sklearn library


# Results and evaluation
The project successfully addressed the challenges of efficient and fair line construction by designing algorithms that 
optimize pipeline placement while considering location constraints The implemented solutions demonstrated 
effective pipeline placement strategies and achieved significant improvements in efficiency and fairness.
