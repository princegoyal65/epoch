# Efficient and Fair Line Construction Project

 

# Project Overview

The Efficient and Fair Line Construction project aims to construct a gas pipeline in a straight line that serves a set of 
houses with coordinates given by latitude and longitude. The project focuses on optimizing the pipeline placement to 
achieve efficiency and fairness while considering the distances from houses to the pipeline.


# Installation and Setup

In this section, provide detailed instructions on how to set up the project on a local machine. This includes any necessary dependencies, software requirements, and installation steps. Make sure to include clear and concise instructions so that others can easily replicate your setup.

## Codes and Resources Used

- **Editor Used:**  Google collab. jupyter note book.
- 

## Python Packages Used
In this section, I include all the necessary dependencies needed to reproduce the project, so that the reader can install them before replicating the project. I categorize the long list of packages used as - 
- **General Purpose:** General purpose packages like `urllib, os, request`, and many more.
- **Data Manipulation:** Packages used for handling and importing dataset such as `pandas, numpy` and others.
- **Data Visualization:** Include packages which were used to plot graphs in the analysis or for understanding the ML modelling such as `seaborn, matplotlib` and others.
- **Machine Learning:** This includes packages that were used to generate the ML model such as `scikit, pandas`, etc.


## Data Acquisition
Dataset is provided we have given califorina housing dataset which we have get from sklearn library


# Results and evaluation
The project successfully addressed the challenges of efficient and fair line construction by designing algorithms that 
optimize pipeline placement while considering location constraints The implemented solutions demonstrated 
effective pipeline placement strategies and achieved significant improvements in efficiency and fairness.
